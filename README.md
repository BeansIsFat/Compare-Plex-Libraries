# Compare Plex Libraries
Script to compare Plex libraries. Written for Cloudbox but could be adapted to other Plex configurations.
Requires ExportTools (https://github.com/ukdtom/ExportTools.bundle/wiki)

Useful if you have a 4K library using Trakt to add items via Radarr and want to make sure you have the regular HD version without having to sync Radarr instances

Only works with Movie libraries at the moment
