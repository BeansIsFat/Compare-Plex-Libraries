# Compare Plex Libraries
Script to compare Plex libraries. Written for Cloudbox but could be adapted to other Plex configurations.
Requires ExportTools (https://github.com/ukdtom/ExportTools.bundle/wiki)

Useful if you have a 4K library using Trakt to add items via Radarr and want to make sure you have the regular HD version without having to sync Radarr instances.
